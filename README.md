# GR36.com

This is an ongoing project for creation and modification of my personal blog. The site uses the basis of Beautiful Jeckyll by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com). [Donate](https://www.paypal.me/daattali/20)

I have modified the usage to my own ends, adding in link collection and post formats to my taste. Everything is free and open for you to fork and use **except** all of the content in the _posts and _img folders. This is expressly my property and is not to be reproduced in any way.

## Contributions

If you find anything wrong (so many typos!) or would like to contribute in any way, feel free to create a pull request/open an issue on the [original project](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). 

## Known limitations

- Due to improving pageation to version 2 and adding auto pages, this theme will no longer work on Github pages, if you intend to use this please use the original theme.

- If you have a project page and you want a custom 404 page, you must have a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.
