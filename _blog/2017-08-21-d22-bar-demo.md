title: "D22 Bar Demo- Devs Test Your Apps"
date: 2017-08-21

Since the iOS11 GM leaked (or was given) to 9to5mac and others there has been a wealth of information being uncovered. This [made some people mad][1], but we now know the [name of the phone][2], lots of details on what it can do and how things will work including [new Animoji feature][3]. 

iOS developer Guilherme Rambo ([@\_inside][4]) has released a way for developers to test their apps with the new iPhone split status bar. D22Bar will enable developers to get a head start on making their apps compatible, but there are some caveats to giving it a try. 

[Head over to Guilherme Rambo Git Hub][5] and follow the instructions in the repository readme file.  This is purely for developers that know what they are doing, and if in any doubt just wait for the tools to be released by Apple next week.

## Disclaimers
* The status bar style will only work with the iOS 11 GM or later, it will not work with previous betas of iOS. If you don't have the GM installed, there's no way to install it currently since Apple stopped signing the leaked builds.
* The metrics (corner radius and notch shape) might not be accurate, this is just an emulation
* Only tested on an iPhone 7 Plus, I don't know how it looks on other devices
* This will not work on the Simulator

# How to use
Just link your app with D22Bar.framework. That's all.
You can embed the framework directly or use Carthage to install it.
Embed directly:
Add D22Bar.xcodeproj and add D22Bar.framework to the Embedded Binaries section in your target settings.
