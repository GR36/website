So a few month ago I was using micro.blog a lot. In fact quite few people called me a [micro.blog evangelist](https://gr36.com/2018-05-25-you're-not-cool-enough-for-micro.blog/). But not long after the post above I left and deleted my account. 

I became annoyed at the service and found it very repetitive. All I saw were the same 'type' of users and posts, finding it very draining to find people to follow or interact with. Many of these issues and feelings I had were early teething issues ( hours to publish a post) or just feeling like I don't fit in. 

I dived back into Twitter again, but kept checking in. I've read some interesting posts over there last few weeks, and more people seem to be interacting now so I will see how it goes again.

So GR36.micro.blog is back in action.
