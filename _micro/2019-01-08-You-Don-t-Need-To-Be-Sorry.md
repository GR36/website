Every now and then I simply leave twitter alone for a bit. I've tried to properly quit a few times but it never really works, I simply have too much invested in the service and meet too many cool people.

Sometimes I just need a break and quite often notice this feeling before it gets out of hand. However there is nothing wrong, you don't need to be sorry for me, I want some time away from all the noise.

This sometimes coincides with a particularly noisy time in my circles, so perhaps CES hasn't helped. I will return but don't be worried for me, or to take a break yourself.
