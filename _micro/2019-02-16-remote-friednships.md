> When we talk about remote work, can we also talk about â€˜remote friendshipsâ€™? Met the best people through Twitter, IG, online connections. ðŸ’™ðŸ¤— - Alex Muench

I need to remember this more than I do. I get obsessed with all the negativity around using social media. Yet most of the connections and friendships I have are those forged online.

The only reason I podcast is because of Twitter and finding people to do it with. Many of the people I consider friends I have never met in person, simply read their words, listed to their voices and occasionally has a conversation across the web. Social media is great when used in the correct, posistive way.
