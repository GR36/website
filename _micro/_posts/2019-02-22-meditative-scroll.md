Social media gets a bad rep at the moment. Screen time this, Twitter that. Much like diet it’s hard to separate the good from the bad, so you just feel guilty whatever you do.

Yet amongst all the barrage of negative press I think there is something to social media usage in a positive way. I’ve found quite a bit of comfort and relaxation from consciously pulling out my smartphone and scrolling by.

Simply scrolling through my feed, and much like meditation, taking in the information and then letting it go is hugely beneficial. Not interacting, not thinking or dwelling, just digesting and letting the information flow past me and out of my mind.

I’m never going to start a new movement with this - but I thought I’d share a bit of positivity towards my smartphone after all the months of self loathing.
