I don't very often link to other websites without a quote from a post, but Andy has been writing some very interesting posts over the last few weeks. He also does a couple of great podcasts and is generally a great person to follow on Twitter. [The Dent](https://thedent.net) is his new website which moves away from a personal blog and you should 100% check out some of his posts and pop his feed in your RSS reader
