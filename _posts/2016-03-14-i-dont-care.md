Here’s why I don’t care what you’re going to do
Some journalists so preoccupied with with what they could write, to think about if they should?

I’m not sure if employed writers have a quota of articles they have to publish to get their pay check? I would presume so, as some seem to chuck out stuff with such a disregard for facts, opinions and their readers that it’s getting quite comical.

To paraphrase Jurassic Park, are some journalists so preoccupied with with what they could write, to think about if they should?

## The Why I am
I point your attention to item number one, at first glance it takes the almost cliche angle of why I X be doing something. In this case why the author Richard Helby won’t be purchasing the Galaxy S7. Granted this is through the public access community, but it quickly descends into complete and utter garbage.

If you can navigate past the nonsense about it not including an IR blaster because he wants to control his TV. It features the golden quote below. Edit: which has now been removed.

Both the S7 and Edge come with a 2.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, which is undoubtedly zippy, but still smaller than the 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 that comes with the GS 5. So with such clueless insights into the world of technology explain to me why anyone should care what you as a person choose to do?

## The Sheep
I also present to you the reviews done by stone cold advocates of competing platforms. This usually takes the form of iPhone users reviewing new Android phones but is not exclusively this way. The most resent example posted by CNET writer David Carnoy when reviewing the Galaxy S7 (popular phone!).

Which halfway through proclaims “But I prefer iOS”. Why exactly are CNET asking someone that is never going to use the platform to review a handset? Sure it’s good to hear the opposing opinions sometimes, but when the main argument is that software updates are two menus deep (as a sidebar so are iOS). Explain to me again why your opinion is so important you have to write this trash?

## Opinions Matter
I mean I’m involved in the industry, I get asked lots of my opinions on all sorts of purchasing decisions. However I wouldn’t dream of giving them based on the information above. Publish them on a private blog sure, but CNET and Engadget should know better.

Reviews are one thing but keep complete conjecture and subjective dribble to yourself.
