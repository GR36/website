title: Try explaining to your 4 year old about gender

I read lots of medium posts, some interest me, some are stupid but some just strike a chord with me straight away. One such post is only a few hours old, about a 3 year old asking why some people are gay. This reminded me of a conversation I had with my son about pink and blue.

I constantly worry about weird things like this, if I am telling my kids the right things. Or even if a 4 year old should be worried about things like this. But it happened on a shopping trip when my Son told me that blue things are for boys and pink things are for girls.

Do I broach this? Or do I do the typical parent thing and dismiss it with a simple “that’s right” and deal with it later. I had done this when James called a chimpanzee a monkey (it’s a not) at Twycross and felt dirty, so I decided to dive in!
Kids are great

I wasn’t expecting a good conversation but much like the story linked earlier he just took it on board and changed his way of thinking. “People can wear or like whatever colour they want, nothing is for particular people” I said, and that was it. “Ok that’s cool” he said and went on his merry way.


Wow. Kids are so accepting and so amazed at the world they could tech us all a thing or two. In a state of constant learning about their environment they leave everything in grown up hands to teach them what they need to know. Which I guess where passing on prejudices and beliefs can happen.

Thankfully there was nothing to worry about at all, but I’m glad I didn’t chicken out. I know I avoided the gender thing quite a bit, but it’s a start. Now for that monkeys vs apes conversation…
