Since pretty much the dawn of time we have been looking for ways to make sure we are different from each other. Understandable when your competing for limited terrain or food sources, yet we still do it whilst wrapped up in an easy existence.

What once was tribal warfare, evolved into splitting ourselves based on arbitrary drawn country borders, and now the lines are draw over some of the most stupid reasons you could imagine.

Jason Manford performed a an extremely funny bit on the fact everyone hates everyone else that is not them. This is almost understandable and nothing more than friendly banter, yet just today people where so emotionally involved in protecting their mobile phone operating system it borders on bazaar.

So called ‘Fanboys’ are nothing new that is for sure, Mac Vs PC, Xbox vs Playstation, Nintendo vs Sega, the list goes on and on. Yet the venom and vitriol spat by some people because they use a specific mobile phone is just stupid. Treating something so arbitrary like it needs to be defend on the same levels as their first born.

Yet the weird thing is I kind of get it, the need to belong as part of a group. The feeling that others share your common interests and beliefs is one of the most powerful things a human can experience. How exactly do you think extremist groups get people do weird and crazy things for weird and crazy reasons?

Hey, one of the most important things to me is my family #TeamMorris. For exactly those reasons, these are people that will love and protect me whatever the circumstance. With that said, why are we intent on separating ourselves out. Just because I am born here, doesn’t make me any different than someone born the other side of the world. We are all exactly the same except for the lives we have led up to that point. 

It makes zero difference based on skin colour, language we speak or where we live so why exactly is my opinion rubbish because I use one phone and you use a different one? Stop being so god dam stupid.
