title: Is that thought true?

It seems as though I am on some kind of journey of late. Since finishing work for Christmas, I have been seeking to improve my health through all sorts of avenues. Both my mental and physical health had taken a huge hit over the preceding 3–4 months so a much needed change was needed.

During the break, rest was definitely on the menu, as well as improving my time spent meditating — which I have already written about. Along with this has come improving my relationship with social media (another thing I have covered already) and also improving my thought processes and emotions.

Spending just 10–20 mins a day meditating and being mindful has defiantly helped but so has questioning my thoughts and reactions. I uncovered a post about the work of [Byron Katie by a couple of fellows of the University of Washington][1]. Byron Katie popularised a technique of questioning your thoughts. Showing there is great power in acknowledging rather than repressing negative thoughts.

Just because your mind creates a thought doesn’t make it true. I quite quickly got into the habit of asking myself “Is that thought true?”. If the answer wasn’t categorically Yes then the thought is forgotten. This has stopped me worrying about things that are just my interpretation and allowed me to recognise when negative thoughts are present.

Instead of trying to ignore something we believe to be true, questioning allows us to see our thoughts “face to face” and to discredit them because they are untrue.
Considering the amount of non verbal communication in the world, it is no wonder the wrong things are interpreted. Leading to stress and worry often over something completely trivial. This practice of questioning every thought you have should become second nature for everyone. There is nothing more interesting to me than having my beliefs and ideas questioned and tested by others. So why shouldn’t I do this to my own mind?

You should give it a go — it’s liberating.
