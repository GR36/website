title: Sleep and me

From the age of around 15 until recently I have a had a real issue sleeping. Sleep was something everyone else did, far too much of it, and I I thought was a waste of time.

It wasn’t unusual in the summer months for me to be out running before 5 am and have completed a half marathon before most people woke up. Sleep is boring and doesn’t get anything done.

If I could just step out of consciousness in an instant, just like that, as easy as walking though a door, then fine. Do what you have to do with transferring memories yadda yadda yadda. I enjoy my waking hours so much I just can’t be bothered. There’s too much information for me to take in, people for me to listen to and things for me to think about to waste time in bed.

Here’s the thing; I know I need to sleep as much as anyone, it’s just going to sleep I don’t like. The act of failing to sleep just seems too long winded and inhuman like. Unfortunately I didn’t realise sleep was so detrimental to health. Sleep deprivation can lead to [higher risk of chronic health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke][1]. Both podcasts and articles I read keep telling me I needed more sleep, so I’ve had to do it.

TV has never really been an issue as I don’t really watch much of it anyway. A blue light filter on my tablet, kindle and phone are supposed to stop that keeping me awake. My Instapaper queue has been slimmed down or read before I go to bed so I don’t engage my brain too much. Throw in some meditation and I’m hopefully getting somewhere near where I need to be.

Maybe I’m getting old, or maybe I’m better at it, but I’m sleeping more.
