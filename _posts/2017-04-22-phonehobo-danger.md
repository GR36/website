title: The dangers of being a phonehobo

What is a phonehobo you ask. It is a term myself and [Kurt Colbeck][1] coined back in 2013 for someone that changes their phones often. They bounce from handset to handset at such a blistering rate they never stop to call one ‘home’. We both knew these people, because we both were these people.

Flash forward to now, its 2017 and and we are both using iPhones. This is not an article with any brand favour, but we both settled and I am sure Kurt won’t mind me speaking for him, the fact is we are much happier for it.

Being a phonehobo, for me at least, was in part caused by Android handsets. There was, and still is, a new handset every other week that promises to be bigger and better than the last one. Thought you where happy with that brand new flagship? Think again because what you really need is THIS new flagship because it’s better.

Android is not to blame, neither are the brands that make the phones. They are businesses and have products to sell by advertising to consumers. The fault is emotions and a lack of fulfilment in life. A constant urge to buy more things, new things, better things, things that will fill the hole in ourselves. At least that’s the promise made by the adverts and reviewers.

You might have exactly the same story with phones, or cars, or clothes or anything you can think of. When really the truth is, buying something won’t make you feel better. I was just hiding behind my stuff, and promising myself that the next one would be THE ONE.

I still get pangs now. Each time a new Android handset is released I think about buying it. It doesn’t do anything different, or better, it ads nothing valuable to my life. Yet I still want to but it!

The only thing that can make me happy is me — not a phone. That’s the danger of being a phonehobo, watch out.
