Do you ever just sit and people watch? It is one of my favourite things to do, just watching and sharing in the lives of others. The people that simply walk past or are just around whatever you are doing are actually really interesting if you just pay attention.

One particular couple sat across from me yesterday, really got me thinking about our relationships. The elderly couple from America, where traveling across the UK and just sat in perfect silence while eating. Far from being strange, I actually found this completely heart warming.

Pulp Fiction said it best in the quote above. Many people would see these two as a couple that had been married so long they simply had nothing to say to each other. Some might even go further and think that after all these years they may actually not really like each other!

Yet, they felt so comfortable with each others company that they could sit, with out all the small talk, and just be with each other. Not distracted by doing other things. Not feeling the need to reassure each other with pointless chit chat, but just enjoy being together without all the noise.

How many times do we feel the need to fill every uncomfortable silence with pointless words. Or occupy our minds with something else to do, which in modern times leads to most people pulling out their smart phone. All this to fill silence that doesn’t need to be filled. If you can turn an uncomfortable silence into a completely comfortable one, you may just feel more engaged with others.
