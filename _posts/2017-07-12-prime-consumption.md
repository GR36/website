title: Prime Day and consumption

Whilst working in retail, one of my colleagues was obsessed with buying everything. To the point he put himself in thousands of pounds of debt and to the point of disparity. Yet every sale time came around he would pull out his debit card with the phrase “but they’re 50% off”.

I spent many an hour trying to explain to him that they’re only 50% off if you wanted to buy them anyway. Whereas if you don’t need them at all, they’re 100% off, and that sale is 365 all year round!

￼ \<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"\>\<p lang="en" dir="ltr"\>Just a friendly reminder. Don&#39;t buy things, unless you really need them folks. \<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmazonPrimeDay?src=hash&amp;ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw"\>#AmazonPrimeDay\</a\>\</p\>&mdash; Callip Hall (@CallipH) \<a href="https://twitter.com/CallipH/status/884766318225915904?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw"\>July 11, 2017\</a\>\</blockquote\> \<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\> 

I’m always reminded of that situation every time a large sale rolls around. Black Friday, Cyber Monday and most recently Prime Day, all evoke this hatred of consumption on a level where a % symbol can make people buy things.
This isn’t a anti capitalist post, because that seems to be the in thing at the moment. I enjoy buying and owning things as much as the next person, but an awareness of [minimalism][1] has taught me so much about worth. The true cost of a ‘thing’ is what we get out of it vs. what we put into it.

Is it worth me buying a new phone because I’m a Phonehobo? Isn’t a decision purely based on the money I have to spend buying the device. However it seems most people are tempted to buy (or consume) just because the sale prices are tempting. I presume most people are, because Twitter is flooded with links from people sharing deals and they wouldn’t do it if people didn’t buy.

The pangs always get me to. Great deals almost feel like you’re missing out on not snapping them up. However think about the story I posted first, unless you were going to buy that item anyway, think more than twice before you click buy. Don’t get caught by sales, and work out if that bargain is really worth it.
