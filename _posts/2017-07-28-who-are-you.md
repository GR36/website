How do you find something when you have no idea what you are looking for? I had no idea what needed to change, but I felt fed up. Fed up of being a shadow of the person I was and the person I should be. Fed up of having no motivation, fed up of being lazy and fed up of the way my brain made me feel.

I was looking for an answer, I was sure there was one but no idea where it would be. I felt lost in a world where slacking off was encouraged, being negative was normal and thinking different was weird. Change was on the verge of becoming impossible, no matter how hard I tried.

Amongst the clouded thoughts and half arsed attempt at everything l simply knew I had to wait until the answer found me. Finding motivation not to set goals, or even to achieve things, but motivation to find what makes me who I am.

What do you truly believe? What in the heart of hearts motivates you to do the things you do?

These are the types of questions that I have found many people do not know — and that worries me. There is a struggle between internal and external forces. If you really didn’t know who you are and what makes you tick, then the external forces are all that is left to rely on.

This is why people crave a fancy job title, more money, and posh car. It all boils down to a craving for someone to tell them who they really are.

As Gandhi outlined above, your beliefs are what ultimately shapes your destiny. Your actions and your outlook on life is cultivated and shaped by what you believe about who you are so shouldn’t you really know?
