title: Amazon Didn’t Kill Retail, It Killed Itself

Many millions of people still buy things from retail stores, this is still a fact that most people predicting doom seem to forget. Yet they still scream that retail has been killed by Amazon and other online retailers. Unfortunately, despite what those who own or work in retail stores believe, the internet isn’t to blame, its you!

Retail stores have had this coming for a long time, people that have braved stores for years are just fed up of their practices. All sort of backwards logic and often foul play is at work inside these meccas of consumerism. That is if you can actually get into the shop in the first place, and navigate your way through the tiny walkways that snake their way to sale Items.

God forbid should you be pushing a pushchair or be using a wheelchair, then your issue may be actually navigating the shop floor at all. The “pile it high” approach coupled with bare minimum attention to neither health and safety nor staffing means you will only see a fleeting glimpse of a staff member, followed by a long line of customers wanting attention.

> “Amazon Prime is why so much physical retail is going away,” said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on the stock and a price target of $1,250. “Anyone who joins Prime shops in retail stores 10 percent less, and that number will keep accelerating as Amazon adds more inventory.”

Once you have decided what you want, you’re not actually allowed to buy it until you have been offered an extended warranty for a low monthly payment. Along with all types of add-ons — from a DVD that shows you how to set your DVD player up to a super secret cleaner that will keep your clothes perfect. You can also put this on a 29.9% APR credit card if you like and save yourself £4.

There is a reason there are longer lines for the self checkout than the miserable teenager scanning your items. Many retailers are still yet to evolve to modern practices and employ members of staff that actually look like they want to work. Many stores are filled full of staff that look like they have stepped out of a group therapy session, and could end it all, right there on the shop floor.

So please stop blaming internet sites. They simply give people what they want in a way they want it. If we are all being honest, no one really wants to shop online for lots of things we buy. Going into a shop should be an experience that is rewarded with a new item, not a battle with a company that puts everything in your way.
