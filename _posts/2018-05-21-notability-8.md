One of my most used apps [Notability](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/notability/id360593530?at=1000ltj4) got a huge update today. I use this for marking up PDF, signing documents I receive through email, taking hand written notes and even the occasional doodle in brain storming sessions. 

The app is hugely versatile already but amongst the many improvements there are a few notable ones - handwritten notes are now searchable and you are even able to open two notes side by side. The full list of updates are listed below - if you use an iPad for any kind of productivity you should [definitely check it out](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/notability/id360593530?at=1000ltj4).

### Handwriting Search (for iPad)
* Handwriting is now searchable from the Library and within a specific note.
* Handwriting can also be converted to text.
* The first time you launch Notability, your library will be indexed. After that, your handwriting will be searchable! If you have a lot of handwriting, creating the initial index may take a while.
### Multi-Note (for iPad)
* Multi-Note lets you work with two notes side-by-side.
* The new Note Switcher lets you switch between notes quickly.
* Supports audio recording and playback.
### Recent Notes
* We added a Recent Notes subject to the Library just below All Notes.
* Recent Notes lists up to 10 of your most recently opened notes.
### Updated Help Center
* The new Help Center can be opened by tapping the question mark in the Library.
* The Help Center contains updated articles and tutorials.
