Despite [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4) being around for ages, I am very new to using it for any length of time. I've already posted about my [love of the app after giving it a chance](https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/), so I won't go into that here but thought I'd share some of my most used and favourite actions.

## Send to Things
I really don't need to discuss my love of [Things](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4) here again, do I? This action enables me to write multiple todos and pass them all to Things at once. Saves loads of time for planning a project or if you take meeting action notes like I do.

## Post to Micro.blog
The greatest thing about Drafts is the fact I start absolutely every bit of text in the app and then pass it to its destination. I start all writing here and if it is long enough or good enough I post to my blog, if not I use this action to post to micro.blog with ease.

## Send To Bear
My longer notes or [lengthy attachments to Things](https://gr36.com/2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-using-bear/) todo items are stored in [Bear](https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/). This action does exactly what it says, passes all text to [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?at=1000ltj4) and creates a new note.

## Post To My Blog
Should the text I'm writing be deemed worthy I post it to my blog hosted on github using Jekyll. In order to do this it needs to have the correct front matter and then be pushed to github using [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?at=1000ltj4). This action does all of that in one tap. I have several of these for posting to different parts of my blog.

## Covert To HTML
I quite often write columns for [newsletters](http://eepurl.com/dvApEj) or websites that require me to send it across in HTML. Or perhaps I just want to see what the page I'm building is going to look like. Whatever the reason this action turns markdown into HTML.

## Do More..
There are hundreds more that I could mention but these are my most used ones. Matt Birchler has also [created some really good ones himself](https://birchtree.me/blog/draft-5-actions-the-birchtree-collection/) and helped out with the post to micro.blog action above. Drafts has become my favourite app and does most of what I used workflow for. I'd love to know your favourite.
