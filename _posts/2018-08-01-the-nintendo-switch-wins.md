Every dam time. Constantly. Always with the idiotic updates. Software update after software update that only happen when I want to pick my Xbox controller up and have a quick game in between the stresses of modern life. It doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;ve turned on update in the background or not because Microsoft love putting road blocks in the way &#8211; and this is why the Nintendo Switch wins the console wars.

It may not be the most powerful machine (it&#8217;s not by a long way) but Nintendo’s new console has won me over completely. The games are easy to pick up, now coming think and fast, I can play it handheld or on the television &#8211; but most of all they got software updates spot on.

Too may times have I been stuck in a loop between not wanting to waste a hour updating my Xbox and needing to be signed into Xbox live simply to play a game. I don’t need to be online to play an quick game of Fifa against the computer so I? Apparently I do, and I have to do a 3gb update just to sign in.

Whereas if the Switch ever needs to update its OS I can play a game and update at my leisure once I have finished playing. No road blocks, a pop up gives me the option and I can decide when to update.

Not to mention the updates take a minute amount of time in comparison, sure the Xbox is infinitely more complicated &#8211; but each and every update I am faced with a boring update screen for an unspecified period of time whilst I wait to play. More often than not I put the controller back down again and simply don’t bother.

For easy access to gaming the Nintendo Switch wins every time.
