It has taken me a surprising amount of time to write this page, not because I don't have time, but because I don't like writing about myself. I am a blogger and podcaster with several years experience in technology circles. As well as working in technology accessibility advice, business consultancy and best of all improving the lives of individuals with various disabilities.

In recent years I have been focusing on Apple related technology, news, hardware and software reviews, as well as ghost writing for several websites. If you are interested in working together please feel free to get in touch through [email](https://gr36.com/contact).

## Affiliate Links
This website does use affiliate links, this is the only monetisation that I use and earns me next to nothing. So any links to Amazon products or the app store will be monetised slightly. I will not push you to buy anything, I will not recommend things that I don't think are good, and I will not over use this.

If you want to help me out click though to [buy your stuff from Amazon here](https://www.amazon.co.uk//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=gr36-21&linkId=abd3804a14f725fbf1861aa2eb0b44f2) and give me a few pence.
