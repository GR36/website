Silly season seems to start earlier and earlier each year. As much as [Apple try to stop it][1], the leaks come thick and fast from WWDC onwards. Each new handset has its leaking star, and so far it has been Benjamin Gaskin, showing off purported iPhone 8 dummy phones.

Well it seems there is another - long time leaker [@onleaks][2] has posted images of a dummy phone which shows many hardware features which have already been leaked.

The leaker posted images on his twitter account which show a design with dramatically slimmed down bezels, meaning glass completely dominates the front of the device. We are yet to actually get a feel for the size of the display under the glass, but [Benjamin returned with a mock up of his thoughts][3].  

Although the front is not entirely bezel-less, the glass features a design similar to the rumoured cut out for the front facing camera, speaker and sensors. Couple this with the removed home button, we have a whole different design on our hands.

The back shows a sign we have been shown before, the vertical aligned dual camera - that is in contrast to the horizontal placement on the current iPhone 7 plus. This is supposedly due to new AR and [biometric features][4]. The ever present camera(s) bump is still there, even with the increased size of the iPhone8.

The iPhone 8 will supposedly measure a little larger than the iPhone 7 with measurements of 143.59 x 70.94 x 7.57 mm, as a posed to 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm for the iPhone 7. The larger size will need to accommodate a screen anything up to a reported 5.8 inches, so it will be much easier to hold as opposed the the plus variants currently on sale.

This iPhone 8 dummy also features a glass back, which does fit with some other rumours, but would make the phone difficult to hold.

That's enough wild speculation for one day! I'm beginning to hate rumours and still holding out for some genuine surprises come September. Fingers crossed.
