title: I Spend Too Much Time Alone

On the second Friday of the month I add up all my mileage and there is never a time when the total doesn't scare me. It's always north of 2500 miles a month an I'm starting to wonder if that's good for me. 

I am sure there are people that do many more, yet presuming I take the regular 1 month off throughout the year. I spend at least 27,000 miles alone just driving. Taking out all traffic jams and other hold ups and accounting for me travelling everywhere at 60mph - that's 458hours of my year. 19 whole days!!

Add into this the time spent eating, waiting for appointments or alone in a hotel room and it's starting to look pretty scary. I love my job but perhaps I spend too much time alone. 

My time is never wasted, I spend all of this time listening to podcasts and audio books - as Aubrey Marcus says [practicing mindfillness](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076Z6KFWL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1?tag=gr36-21).
