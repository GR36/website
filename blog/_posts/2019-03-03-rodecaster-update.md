On the very last day of the month Rode released software version 1.1.0 for its podcast mixer the Rodecaster Pro. No big deal you might think, software updates come out all the time, but this one enables the hardware to output multiple tracks via USB and makes recording and editing a podcaster even easier.

This was one of the biggest push backs against the unit when first released, that many producers much prefer to edit their audio in post and add in all of the extra sounds as well as cut out any issues. Rode were listening and announced an update to the unit soon after, and this was the biggest reasons I kept using mine.

Once updated the RodeCaster Pro can not only output 1 or 2 tracks, it now has the ability to output 14 via USB. You keep a stereo output of the 'master track' but also mono outputs for Mic 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as stereo for the USB input, TRRS phone connector, Bluetooth input, and also the sound pads.

There are many more improvements, for all the details about the release head over to the software release [page](https://www.rode.com/blog/all/RODECaster-Pro-Multitrack). The new firmware update includes:

* Multitrack output to USB
* Ability to remove audio processing from multitrack outputs, while it remains on main stereo mix
* Colour coded microphone channels
* Pulsing record button to indicate when the unit is armed to record
* Updated menu layout

In order to update your Rodecaster Pro to the new version you must download a new version of the companion software. This is available for both Windows and Mac, and easy to get from the [Rode website](https://www.rode.com/rodecasterapp), it's important to note that previous versions will not function with firmware update 1.1.0.
