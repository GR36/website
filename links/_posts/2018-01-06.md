>Follower counts are not very useful for a new platform. They add anxiety and unavoidably lead to value judgements when considering whether to follow someone, instead of letting the quality of someone’s writing and photos speak for itself.

I’ve written several times about my love hate relationship with writing. Worrying about what people will read on and share. Logging onto analytics ridiculous times a day to have a look. But a post by the creator of micro blog Manton Reece may have finally lasted my feelings to rest. His blog post about [not worrying about numbers][1] and why Micro.blog doesn’t have follower counts is great. It shows the ethics of the platform and also some great thoughts about Facebook!
