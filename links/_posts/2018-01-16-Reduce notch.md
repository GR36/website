> According to industries, it is heard that Apple is planning to strengthen face sensing function starting from 2019 models. That is why it is planning to increase number of parts that will be used for iPhones and is looking into combination of a face recognition module with a camera module.

I am surprised this wasn’t the case with the first gen, however it make sense given the rush to release the iPhone X last year and not 2018.

Reducing parts should also reduce the notch, right? Right!
