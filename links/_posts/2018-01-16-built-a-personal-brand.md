[How I Built A Personal Brand That Turned Me Into A Full-Time Writer](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-i-built-a-personal-brand-that-turned-me-into-a-full-time-writer-1fd0f03c9cc)

I have never really been fussed about being paid for my writing or content creation. However I have found the best way, and to cut out all the hassle, is to write for other people.

I wrote more words in 2017 for other people to put their name on that I did my own. And long may it continue.

Never be afraid to drop your ego.
