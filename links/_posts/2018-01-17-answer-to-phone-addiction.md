[Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone? - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html)

Although I completely understand where this article is coming from. I don’t agree the answer is Apple themselves to make a worse phone.

Apple have no interest in keeping you invested in your phone and holding your attention. They have already made their money so the transaction is pretty much over.

However it is app and platform designers that are to blame. Their whole business model is built around attention and a worse phone to use wouldn’t curb this much. It would purely move the issue to OEM that make better phones.

The answer is inside us.
