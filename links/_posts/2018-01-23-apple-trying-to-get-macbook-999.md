The MacBook running iOS is the iPad Pro?

Whilst I see where Matt I coming from I just don’t see that this would sell very well. It may be appealing to us nerds that already work on their iPad/iPhone. But Apple must sell tens of millions fo devices to make it worth while.

Such is the life of one of the biggest companies in the world!
