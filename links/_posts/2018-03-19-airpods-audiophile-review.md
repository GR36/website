[Apple AirPods: the audiophile review - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17138258/apple-airpods-audiophile-review-wireless-headphones)

Could it be that design is not simply about the way a product looks?

I am glad that people that were dismissive about the looks of AirPods are finally appreciating how good they are. However I am annoyed that this took more than a year!
