As Joe Rogan says The universe  does indeed reward hustle, but your body doesn’t have a limitless ability to keep going. It isn’t a competition to see who can keep going the longest and one quote from Jason Fried is at least trying to buck this horrible trend:

> A lot of entrepreneurs onstage have been bragging about not sleeping, telling their audiences about their 16-hour days, and making it sound like hustle-at-all-costs is the way ahead. Rest be damned, they say - there’s an endless amount of work to do.  

This badge that people that are successful seem to wear is not just damaging to your long term health but also more often that not untrue. Sleep might seem like a waste of time but enables you to performa much better in the hours you are awake. [Gary Vee](https://medium.com/@Philbert440/the-universe-rewards-hustle-c6354305c4a6) is often one of the people that people look to for inspiration and motivation - yet he supports down time. 

Go hard, but don’t kill yourself doing it.
