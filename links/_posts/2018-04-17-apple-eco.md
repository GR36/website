Long time Apple enthusiast Federico Viticci has been fighting using Apple products exclusively for quite a while, but has finally given up. He wrote:

I've progressively gotten deeper in the Apple ecosystem and I don't feel like I'm being underserved by some aspects of it anymore. - [Erasing Complexity: The Comfort of Appleâ€™s Ecosystem  

I have also started to embrace using the stock Apple apps and services more, yet still cant get to grips with everything. Without doubt apps such and Notes and even Mail prove over time to be more robust than third party systems. However there are still some pretty large holes in Calendar and most of all Reminders. It seems that not everything gets the same attention as others.

There is no denying that in terms of hardware its hard to find equals to AirPods, iPad and even I would argue to some extent HomePod. As frustrating as Siri is, with regard to music there is no equal in finding exactly the song or album you want to listen to.
