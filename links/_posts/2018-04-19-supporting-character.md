> You are not the center of the universe, you’re a supporting character in everyone else’s story. You can be the lone wolf hero in your own world, but that really just writes you out of everyone else’s narrative.
[A Supporting Character in Everyone Else’s Narrative – BirchTree](https://birchtree.me/blog/a-supporting-character-in-everyone-elses-narrative/)

Straight after this posted I tweeted about how profound I found this quote from what is essentially a technology Blog. It has been rattling around in my head ever since and think it deserves  more time than the 1minute read time the post takes.

Matt is not the first to say such a thing, but he posed the question as part of a larger debate around technology circles. We all feel like the world revolves around us, we all feel like the world owes us something, yet in reality we are all the same person. We all arrive with a blanck slate and it is only our life to this point that has changed us.

Other people are far more important than you are, as Matt says "Build those relationships."
