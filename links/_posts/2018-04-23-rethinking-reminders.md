> What I can envision for Reminders is a blending of the some commonly used features for these apps, and doing what they do best — create a version that, while not first, is nearly equal to alternatives and is natively a part of the OS

Many of the issues I have with the Reminders app are pretty easy solves. The UI is extremely dated and as such exaggerates the confused nature of the layout. The cards based UI appears to be where Apple are focusing so it wouldn’t take much work to make it look a whole lot better. 

Looks aside the app provides many of the features that users will need. Reminders simply needs some TLC similar to the improvements Ape made to notes. My worry is that Apple have no intention of making any massive jumps forward with their stock apps and simply only worked on Notes because of the Apple Pencil.
