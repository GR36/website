> Apple has said that by the end of 2018, 60% of US retail locations will take Apple Pay. That’s a substantial number of business locations, and it’s a number that’s only going up. But there are still some hold outs. On the one hand, there are merchants who process through providers that either don’t support Apple Pay or make it a pain to use. That group isn’t who I’ll be looking at today. Instead, I want to look at Target to try and understand why they don’t take Apple Pay, and what they’re doing instead.
