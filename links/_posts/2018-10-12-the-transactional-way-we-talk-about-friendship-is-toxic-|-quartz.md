> The way we talk about friendship paints an ugly picture of the new notion of relating—one that seeks maximum return on minimal investment, and outlines an exit strategy anytime a friend doesn’t fulfill our fantasies.

Guilty!

I have been seeing more and more of this kind of advice lately. Presumptively everyone has friends that are more take than give, but they must add value to still be friends. 

Heaven forbid someone should be sad, or not happy enough to be graced with your presents. Be mindful of social responsibility but don't cut people out because they forget your birthday.
