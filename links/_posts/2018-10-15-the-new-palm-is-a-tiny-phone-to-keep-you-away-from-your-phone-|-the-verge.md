> The Palm phone is a device that you can add on to your Verizon plan, which shares your phone number. It’s a phone designed for you to use on the weekends, when you’re going out for the evening, or just generally when you want to be a little less distracted by your big phone with all its apps.

Is this the most 2018 product? A small phone, to make you put down your big phone instead of using self control. Just wow!
