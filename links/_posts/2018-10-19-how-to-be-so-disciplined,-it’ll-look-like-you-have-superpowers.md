> This was me. For 4.5 years, I tried to be a consistent, disciplined writer. Iâ€™d watch Gladiator or Braveheart and get real motivated, then crank out some of the most heartfelt articles I could possibly write. But upon seeing that no one read my stuff, Iâ€™d give up and quit for months at a time.

I have this issue constantly. Writing all the time for a few months and then disappearing for a while. However his posts speaks lots of truth and hopefully will aid me to keep pushing forward. ðŸ¤ž
