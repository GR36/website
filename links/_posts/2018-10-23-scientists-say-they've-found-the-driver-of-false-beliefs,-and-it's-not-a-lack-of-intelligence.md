> "If you think you know a lot about something, even though you don't, you're less likely to be curious enough to explore the topic further, and will fail to learn how little you know," says one of the team members behind the new study, Louis Marti from the University of California, Berkeley.

Oh. So there is no direct link between intelligence and not fact checking yourself? I understand the point attempting to be made here, people are more likely to live in an echo chamber. However surely people know how to fact check themselves and listen to over whelming push back?

There is a difference between thinking differently from evidence like Graham Hancock and thinking the world is flat.
