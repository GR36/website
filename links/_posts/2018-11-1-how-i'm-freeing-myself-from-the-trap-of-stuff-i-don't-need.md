> Will it give my life meaning? Make my life easier, better? Why do I really want it? Is it only because I am chasing a feeling? Or because I want to squelch one? What would happen if I didnâ€™t buy it?

The number one word you will hear me repeat when talking about my technology now is value. It's a question that I ask myself almost constantly about apps, services and hardware. 

Will it add value to my life? Will I gain something from the purchase outside of a happy feeling that wear off after a few moments. The answer more often than not is no.
