> Also, be extremely skeptical of anyone who makes a judgement about switching to an iPad when they haven’t actually done it themselves (this goes for most judgements about most things throughout life). This group includes the apparent majority of tech journalists, most of whom seem to have an annual ritual of spending one week with the newest iPad, and then saying it’s not a laptop replacement yet in some general sense. How would you even know? I certainly didn’t until six months or so in.

This is dead on correct. I have fallen out of faith with many reviews on tech sites. This doesn't just refer to iPad reviews, but it has increased the frustration. How can you review something like the iPad without actually using it for a serious amount of time. Posting a review of a different phone each week is one thing, but not actually using a whole other system and drawing a judgement is the wrong take.

I appreciate that the iPad is polarising bit of tech, and I am more than slightly bias. It's not a computer for everyone - but it might be for you if you actually TRY!
