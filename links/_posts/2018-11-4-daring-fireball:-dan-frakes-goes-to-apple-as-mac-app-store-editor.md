> The talent pool writing about Apple products and platforms from outside the companyâ€™s walls is getting noticeably shallower. 

I don't agree with this statement at all. And it's typical that someone like John would make it. There is a huge talent pool of people writing about Apple for the enjoyment and a huge community of bloggers and video makers. 

The issue is all of the 'old guard' and still clinging onto each other and not open to others. You only have to point to the iPhone X reviews fiasco and all the toys that were thrown out of the Pram to see the attitudes we are dealing with.
