> The iPad Proâ€™s are not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination. They are also, potentially, almost too powerful for what you can do with them right now. These two points, however, go hand in hand. The hardware is only half of the equation. Yes, they are quite expensive for a tablet, but they are also priced quite well when you consider it as a laptop.

Now People that actually use an iPad will begin to tell you what the difference these upgrades make to their usage. Andy's thoughts mirror most of my own and almost make me want to write a post. 

The hardware is only part of the equation - and when looked at individually the upgrades aren't huge. However I have found that the whole package together makes a huge difference to me that it's hard to put my finger on one thing.
