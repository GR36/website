> As I noted in Deep Work, if you took the contents of the standard Facebook or Instagram feed and published it on a blog, it wouldn’t attract any readers, or comments, or links. But put this content on a Facebook wall and there’s an implicit social contract in place to motivate the people you know to click a like button, or leave a nice comment in the anticipation that you’ll do the same.

This is actually one of the most interesting points I have come across in a long time. If you used 99% the content posted to social media and put it on a blog - no one would read it. Yet why are people so interested in consuming bits of other peoples lives?

I have absolutely no idea - but I have a feeling that Facebook is pulling on something that we will never understand. The vast majority of these posts don't offer value, they are posted so others can get a hit of dopamine from a like or a retweet. Does that make us drug dealers?
