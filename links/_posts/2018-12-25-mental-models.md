> When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision making and outcomes.

This is something I have been thinking about a lot recently. I think it’s natural to not want to appear ‘weak’ by admitting you can’t do something. It leaves you feeling a little exposed and vulnerable - if you’re doing something serious. 

But far too many times have I felt inadequate because someone else is better at a task than me. Yet we all have strengths and weaknesses and there is nothing wrong with admiring this to yourself.
