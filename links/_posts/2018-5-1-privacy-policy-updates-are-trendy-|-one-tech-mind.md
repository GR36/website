> There’s a silver lining in the aftermath of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica fiasco: everyone and their mother are updating privacy policies right now. Go ahead, check your inbox; I bet you have quite a few. Maybe it’s a bit marketing fluff, but the optimist in me hopes there is good intention.

You've got new GDPR regulation in the EU to thank for his. Rather than creating multiple terms of service most services are rolling out the regulation to all users. So you all benefit from better privacy policies thank to the EU. 

The down side of this is some services are pulling out of European countries instead. Which seems to be causing a stir, but if the business isn't viable you can't really blame them. 

However I would cast an eye over these companies more than others just to check it's not just about costs.
