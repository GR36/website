> You don’t meditate to prove that you have great focus. You meditate to get better at noticing when you’re thinking and better at letting your thoughts go.

Meditation and mindfulness has really bad PR. It's not all rainbows, Silicon Valley douches and yoga. It's the simple act of getting better at focusing on yourself and letting your thoughts go. 

There is no pressure to do it for any length of time, or a particular way. But the more you do it the better your focus will become and you will begin to recognise how much time you spend not present at all. Think of it as a bicep curl for the mind.
