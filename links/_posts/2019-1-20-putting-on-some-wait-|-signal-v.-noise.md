> Whenever there’s an opportunity to pick the wait, I’m picking it. And I’m not filling my time with other things I have to do while waiting – I’m genuinely waiting. Waiting while doing nothing. Idling. If I’m in line, and it’s moving slowly, I’m not reflexively reaching for my phone to soak up the dead space. I’m just enjoying having absolutely nothing to do.

Over the last few weeks I have been pondering a post in which I encourage people to be bored. It is one of the biggest things that has increased my mental health and also my creativity. 

Taking extra time is key. Taking in your environment when waiting at a checkout, appreciating noises and smells when out and about, and just taking your time.

I often enjoy nothing else but focusing on what is actually going on around me. Sure we all often know, but do we take time to study it? Put in some wait in your own life and you will be glad you did - I promise.
