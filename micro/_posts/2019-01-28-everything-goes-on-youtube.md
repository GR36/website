Whilst scrolling through all the hate and outrage on Twitter I discovered a recent poll that surprised me. Presumably to find out where to publish to, a podcast was asking where people consume their podcasts. Quite normal, the surprising result was that the most popular answer was YouTube. But before all podcasts rush to create a channel this is worth thinking about.

This doesn't mean that all of a sudden all shows are going to get loads of listens. YouTube is visual, the types of podcasts consumed are going to be studio based, video productions. They aren't auto generated, audio only YouTube snooze casts. Think more Joe Rogan experience than sound bites against stock video footage.
