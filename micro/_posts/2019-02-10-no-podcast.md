I’ve been hard at it recording, editing and arranging guests for my podcasts for the last 4 or 5 weeks. It’s been great so far and I’ve got some really great episodes to release yet - but also very stressful.

So from now on I won’t be recording, editing or anything else during the weekends. I need some down time and this weekend has proved it helps. Looking forward to getting going again Monday evening with another fantastic guest!
