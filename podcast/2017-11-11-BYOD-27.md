This week we have a special guest - Matt Birchler, which joins us to talk about the his impressions of the Pixel 2 - Matt’s annual Android experiment, the experience of  using an Android device with an Apple Watch, and the Pixel 2’s shortages that come up only when using the device (hint: the camera).

Also, we continue with the world’s longest follow-up about Qualcomm and talk about the iPhone X, and the Watch Series 3.
