This week we have a special guest - Guilherme Rambo (AKA Mr. Rambo), which reveals the ludicrous prices of Apple products in Brazil. Also, Gui joins Nati as they both share their impressions of the iPhone X, before diving deep into some nerdy talk about BridgeOS and the iMac Pro which will come with an A10 SoC.

Then we continue to talk about the HomePod and whether Apple's software game has taken a hit in recent years.
