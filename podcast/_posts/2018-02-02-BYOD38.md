We talk about ML platforms, and how Facebook messenger’s chatbot failed while smart assistants won. We also discuss digital assistant and data collection. Greg ordered a HomePod and thinks that Siri should become a platform, and Nati hopes that the HomePod would push them to take Siri more seriously. We continue with the iOS 12 rumors saying that Apple is focusing on stability instead of major new features, and finish with the baffling iPhone with the 6.1” LCD screen.
