We are joined this week by Matt Birchler, who compares his Android experiment with Greg. We continue with Apple Watch, watchOS 5 wishlist, and the smartwatch landscape which has only 2 major players - Apple and Tizen powered Samsung Gear, going forward.

Also, we talk about the HomePod, as Matt shares, his impressions and Greg explains why he bought a 2nd HomePod.
