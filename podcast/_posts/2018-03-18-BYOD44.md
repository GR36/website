Gui (AKA Mr. Rambo) returns and pushes his luck again about his MacBook Pro's keyboard, and revealed that Apple has a special way to calibrate 3D Touch on iPhone screens. Also, Greg and Gui talk about the HomePod experience and AirPlay bugs, which takes us discussing Siri - as a failed software project.

In addition, we talk about Apple's next events: WWDC and the education March event, and Nati exploads about Apple's review process, as Gui helps with some "App Review therapy".
