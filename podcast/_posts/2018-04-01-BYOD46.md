Greg is messing with his setup just before the show (again). But that doesn’t stop us from discussing the Apple education event which was boring because of us, and the story Apple tried to tell and how the Pencil fits in. We also talk about event storytelling, and whether Apple’s efforts will help them to regain the education market. We ramble for a while about Apple Watch bands before going into Facebook’s shady privacy policies, how will the China-US relationship affect Foxconn acquisition of Belkin and what would you do with a 512GB smartphone.
