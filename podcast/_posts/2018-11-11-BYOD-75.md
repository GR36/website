Nati tells Greg about his weird dream about being late to recording, and also how he enjoyed Maniac on Netflix. Greg, which was late to recording the podcast, gets his personal podcast on iTunes.

We also talk about the new iPad Pro, as Greg gives his thoughts about the future of computing, whether the iPad still falls between the Notebook and the smartphone, and his worries that Apple will over-complicate the iPad.

In addition, Nati explains to Greg why Apple will stop revealing unit sales and how it actually makes sense
